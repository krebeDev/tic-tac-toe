# Tic-Tac-Toe App

A *simple* tic-tac-toe application built with `React` :atom_symbol:.

## Introduction

This is my first attempt at `React`. I wanted to begin with something simple, and from the original source, in order to understand the basic concepts of how `React`'s elements and components work. I would say I learnt alot :heart_eyes: in this little piece of app.
